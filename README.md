Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify cancer grades using clinical and mutation data. By leveraging various algorithms and conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, we aim to:

  * Understand Data Characteristics: Visualize and analyze the distribution of cancer grades and their relationships with other clinical features such as age and mutation statuses.
  * Preprocess Data: Standardize numerical features and create new features to improve model performance.
  * Train Multiple Models: Implement and train different machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and MLP Classifier.
  *Evaluate Model Performance: Assess the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to identify the best performing algorithm.
  *Optimize Model Parameters: Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
  *Deploy the Best Model: Save the best performing model for future use and make predictions on unseen data to validate its effectiveness.

Ultimately, this project seeks to provide insights and tools that can aid in the classification of cancer grades, potentially contributing to better diagnostic and treatment planning in clinical settings.
